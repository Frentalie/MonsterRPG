# MonsterRPG
This is a project I started last november. I'm currently making a text-based RPG game(a lot harder than it looks)
These are the objectives I'm looking foward to complete before the end of march - 
<li>Add use/look at resources (50%)</li>
<li>	Add more mobs (30%)</li>
<li>	make hunger decrease when exploring (0%)</li>
<li>	random events when exploring (0%)</li>
<li>	add lvl system (10%)</li>
<li>	make humans die when health>0 (0%)</li>

If you have any suggestions just make a pull request; I'll take a look at it :)
